## 1. Introduction

It's a repository for **good quality employment information** for junior developers. 
I'd like to include an intern/new/junior recruitment & hackathon schedule. 
The period means **closing of documents**. 
(If you find out that the recruitment has been completed, please make a Pull Request.)

## 2. PR Rules

* If you don't have a fixed period, you can write as **Undetermined**.
* You have to change **db.json** Too.
* db.json is for **automation** in telegram bot. [co-duck Site](https://co-duck.com/)    
* It will be automated on a separate site or on Facebook.
    * Rule for db.json is```yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss```.
    * If it has only closing date, please set closing time as ```23:59:59```.

## 4. Recruitments (2019)

Every notice of employment in this chapter is for **new/junior** from **a good company for developers to build a career**.

> Significant traffic occurs,
Have Code Reviews, Continuous Deployment, etc. 
Refers to a company interested in code quality.

Companies with a JobPlanet rating of 3.3 or less can't add to it even if you give them PR.
The purpose of this repository is to gather **good quality employment information** in one place. 
**I'm not trying to contain all the company's recruitment information**.  
If there is a company that has low JobPlanet ratings but you really want to recommend it, please leave the reason for that in PR.

### How to get employment information

**Personally, I don't recommend recruitment information for Job Korea or people..**. 


**잡코리아, 사람인 채용 정보는 개인적으로는 추천하지 않습니다**.  
You may skip any additional forms or comments that appear to be copy & paste into your employment information.
If **the companys are not interested in hiring as much, you can think that they don't have enough understanding of the developer**. 
Below are the JobPlanet/Wanted search criteria that I visit regularly.
I'd like you to refer to it.
